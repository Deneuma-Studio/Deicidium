# Deicidium Engine
**Deicidium** (aka Saikou Engine) is a high-performance game engine with cutting-edge technolgoies targeting Microsoft Windows (x64) powered by the [Jenova Framework](https://github.com/Jenova-Framework). 

It builds upon the architectural foundation of [Godot Engine](https://github.com/TheAenema/godot-jenova), introducing a restructured core designed for speed, precision and developer autonomy.  By removing legacy constraints, Deicidium provides a streamlined environment optimized for modern game development workflows and real-time execution. It uses C++ to extend engine capabilities while maintaining optimal performance and low-level control.
